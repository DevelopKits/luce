------------------------------------
A GUI Module for Lua (based on JUCE)
------------------------------------

.. image:: http://peersuasive.github.io/images/lua-inside.png


``Luce`` 0.3.2 *trust in stilts* `released ! <https://github.com/peersuasive/luce/releases/tag/v0.3.2>`__

`Downloads`_ for Linux, Windows, OS X, iOS and Android are available.

What is ``Luce`` ?
==================

``Luce`` is a `Lua <http://lua.org>`_ module for GUI programming based
on the portable, embeddable, remarkable C++ library `JUCE <http://www.juce.com>`_.

It can be used as an ordinary module for pure lua 5.1/lua 5.2/luajit 2.X
scripts or as a library for C++/Lua projects.

Although based on JUCE, Luce isn't aiming at becoming a binding for JUCE,
though the low level API free of Luce features could be used as such.

Luce has Lua in mind and will be developped for lua developpers.

Lua essence is to be "``a powerfull, fast, lightweight embeddable scripting
language.``" And so would Luce be too.

Luce is light, fast and `easily portable
<https://github.com/peersuasive/luce_embeddable>`_, thanks to Lua and JUCE
itself.

As of now, it's supported on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, with partial support
for iOS and Android.

Getting started
===============

1. `download`_ the lua module for your environment

2. put it somewhere in your lua modules path (ex: ``/usr/local/share/lua/5.1``)

- if you're on Linux, you can also use the provided `luarock
  <https://github.com/peersuasive/luce/raw/master/luce-scm-0.rockspec>`_

- if you don't know JUCE, you should consider having a look at its
  `documentation <https://www.juce.com/api/annotated.html>`__ as Luce low level
  API matches for the most part JUCE's own API.

A first app: say hello

----------------------------------------------------

.. code:: lua
   
    local luce = require"luce"()
   
    ---
    --- create a default JUCEApplication

    --- create a Label
    ---

    label:labelTextChanged(function(...)
        print("Label text has changed: ", label:getText()) -- or label.text

    --- set label editable
    label:setEditable(false, true, true) -- edit on single click, edit on double click, 
                                         -- cancel changes when losing focus
    --- we can attach the label to the button too                                     
    label:attachToComponent( button, true ) -- component, true: onLeft/false: above (default)

        --dw:setCentrePosition{ 0, 0 } -- move it to the top left corner
    
        --dw:setBounds{ 100, 100, 800,600 } -- sets the window bounds
                                            -- as dw is a TopWindow and, as such, the very 1st component,

                                            -- on screen directly, so that's another way of

        stop_now = true
        mainWindow:quit()
    end)

    --- main loop

    --- there are two implementations of the main loop
    --- one is the JUCE's native wrapped one
    --- and the other one gives control over the loop
    --- so actions can be taken during the process execution

    -- luce:start( mainWindow ) -- the simplest one, everything's under 
                                -- JUCE control

    --- and the non automatic one
    --- the function's executed in a loop within a thread,
    --- so there's no need to loop here
    --- it is set with the same rate than the JUCE's loop (1ms by default)
    luce:start_manual( mainWindow, 1, function(...)
        -- do some stuff, like zmq:poll(), for instance
        return stop_now
    end )

Requirements and dependencies
=============================

To simply use Luce as a module,

* lua 5.1 / lua 5.2 / luajit 2.X

to compile the module and for C++ projects
------------------------------------------

* C++11
  
* GCC 4.6+ / CLANG 3.3+

To extend with new JUCE classes 
-------------------------------

* ``JUCE`` 3.0.6+


.. _download:

Downloads
=========

As of v0.3.1, modules are available for both lua5.1/luajit2.X and lua5.2.

To use with lua scripts as a module, pick the module download.

If you want to contribute and help debugging, get the debug version of the
module also.

And if you want to use `Luce/Embedded
<https://github.com/peersuasive/luce_embeddable>`_ or develop with C++, get the
static library (or use the module as a shared library, if you prefer to).

For iOS, only the static library is available as Apple policies wouldn't allow
a shared version but if you'd like to deploy on jailbroken devices, just ask,
I'll provide it with the next release.

For Android, at the opposite, only the shared library/module is available, as a
static library wouldn't really make sense, but feel free to ask also.

What's implemented so far ?
===========================

Basically, most of the core components are implemented, as well as OpenGL.

Most of the Graphics painting operations are also implemented, as well as the
most usefull math/geometry classes.

Some components you might find usefull may be missing, so don't hesitate to ask
for adding (or fork the repo and follow the guide `Adding new
classes to Luce`_ then send a *pull request*).

Luce design
===========

All Luce classes start with a ``L``.

Luce design is close to JUCE's, but often simplfied when it doesn't make sense
in lua to keep some if its behaviour or features.

For the general GUI design, see JUCE.

All widgets are derived from Juce's Component class and Luce's LComponent
class. All non-widgets classes are derived from LBase. LComponent itself is
derived from LBase. LBase offers the required link to Lua while LComponent
offers the required links to Juce.

Most of the callbacks existing in Juce also exist in Luce; in the same manner
they need to be overriden in Juce to take effect, they also need to be
overriden in Luce, that is, as for Luce, that a lua function needs to be
provided for the callback to be effective. If no callback is provided, the
default Juce action is called, if any.

All L* classes map their Juce equivalent or are specific to Luce (like LBase).

All L* classes are overridable within lua code, like any pure lua modules, and
most of them are partly implemented in Lua. This is particularly useful for
callback declarations or to add actions to native methods or simply to
specialise a component with new functionnalities.  This is the mechanism we use
to implement C++ classes directly in Lua.

There's a limitation, though, unless it's a callback, as it's not possible to
reimplement a native method in lua -- hence the use of a lua class wrapping the
native one.

Differences with ``JUCE``
=========================

For simplicity and reference, ``Luce`` usually uses the same method names than
``JUCE``. However, where ``JUCE`` uses getters/setters, Luce offers a direct
value attribution, whenever possible and obvious, that is. For instance,
``setName("...")`` and ``getName()`` would be replaced with ``name [= "..."]``,
though set/get methods are still accessible.

Another different is for JUCE's overloaded methods for both; wherever a more
compact form exists that can be substituted with tables, Luce will always
implement this compact form, leaving the detailed one.

For instance, if a method can accept both a Rectangle and four number x,y,w,h,
Luce will accept either a LRectangle or the table {x,y,w,h} but not the four
numbers.

So JUCE documentation is applicable for most of the Luce's low level components.

``Luce`` doesn't provide any listener class directly (and probably won't) but
instead wraps the listeners, where relevant, on the C++ side; as such, there's
no point in having ``addListener`` and ``removeListener`` functions taking a
listener class as argument; but one would be able to enable or disable such
listeners so these methods still exist in ``Luce`` though they just
activate/deactivate the wrapped Listener. 

Some future use cases may reveal the need for such an availability but at the
moment, we haven't found any.

Another difference is with Rectangle and Point objects, for which we didn't
find any use to provide natively. These classes are provided as pure lua
indexed tables and recreated wherever needed. So where a ``JUCE`` method needs
a ``Rectangle`` or ``Point`` object, a table containing the values must be
provided instead. Order is always x, y [, w, h ]. In general speaking, it
respects the order declared in the class constructor. Later on, there'll probably
be a lua implementation of these classes, to offer some of their most useful
methods, like ``:reduce()``.

Adding new classes to Luce
==========================

There are two kinds of classes in ``Luce``: *full* classes and *wrapper* classes.

Full classes are just ``JUCE`` classes extended to be integrated with ``Luce``,
while wrapper classes are there to create some kind of inheritence between
``Luce`` components.

For the 1st one, see ``LLabel``, ``LTextEditor`` or ``LTextButton``, while
the only example for the 2nd kind is ``LComponent``.

``LLabel``, ``LTextEditor`` and ``LTextButton`` extend their respective
``JUCE`` component while inheriting ``LComponent``, which in turn wraps all
``JUCE``'s ``Component`` base class methods.

This allows simulating inheritence in ``Luce`` components, as it wouldn't be
possible in a simple way otherwise. Like previously said, we're not aiming
at a 1 to 1 binding to ``JUCE``, so more complex mechanisms would be oversized
here (unless someone knows a simple way to achieve this, of course !).

There is a helper script, ``microparser``, which greatly simplify the job
of creating new classes for ``Luce``. It won't generate a new "ready to use"
class but gives a great help by generating the class template and headers
with all available methods and callbacks and pre-implementing them.
The most obvious ones are fully generated.

To add pseudo-inheritence, use the script ``create_inh.sh``:

.. code:: sh

    ./create_inh.sh <Luce_CLASS_BASE_NAME>


which generates the ``LCLASS_inh.h`` header to be included in the class.

Once the class is created, include it in ``luce.cpp``, ``luce.h`` and reference it in ``Main.cpp``:

.. code:: c++

    int l_NewClass(lua_State *L) {
        Luna<LNewClass>::Register(L);
        return 1;
    }

    static const luaL_reg luce_lib [] = {
        { "NewClass", l_NewClass },
        [...]
        {NULL, NULL}
    };

 

``Luce`` Roadmap
================

``Luce`` is now stable and complete enough to implement some GUI applications.

It's still lacking a high level API to hide the relative complexity of JUCE, though.

* documentation

* high level API (to create classes, maybe inheritence (@see `30log <https://github.com/Yonaba/30log.git>`__, for instance.)

* integrate debugging facilities

* events broadcasting, be it JUCE's or something else

* portability: finalise Windows and OSX, optimisations for Android and iOS, start \*BSD

* ease look-and-feel customisation
