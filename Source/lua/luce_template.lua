--- main loop

--- there are two implementations of the main loop
--- one is the JUCE's native wrapped one
--- and the other one gives control over the loop
--- so actions can be taken during the process execution

-- luce:start( mainWindow ) -- the simplest one, everything's under 
                            -- JUCE control

--- and the non automatic one
--- the function's executed in a loop within a thread,
--- so there's no need to loop here
--- it is set with the same rate than the JUCE's loop (1ms by default)
luce:start_manual( mainWindow, function(...)
    return keep_going
end )


luce:shutdown() -- in any case, call this to close cleanly
